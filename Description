This is an empty Repo, you can start fresh.
Im looking to have you create the greatest, most advanced, modern, user friendly visually world class app for Contractors.
FieldPro ‚Äì AI-Powered Contractor Assistant
A mobile-first PWA for plumbers, electricians, and HVAC workers that:

Tracks jobs, materials, and time on site

Auto-generates branded invoices

Includes a voice-activated assistant for hands-free logging

Uses image recognition to auto-tag tools or parts from a job site photo

Why it works: Niche field + automation = big demand. Contractors hate paperwork.
The Market Is Massive
There are 3.1 million+ field service contractors in the U.S. alone (electricians, plumbers, HVAC, etc.).

Most still rely on pen/paper, Google Sheets, or outdated tools.

Here's What Big Players Offer (and Why It‚Äôs Not Enough)
Company	Product	Why It's Not FieldPro
ServiceTitan	Enterprise-grade software	Overkill. Complex. Expensive ($200+/mo/user). Designed for large companies with dispatchers, not individual contractors.
Jobber	Scheduling + invoicing	No AI. Forms-heavy. Lacks hands-free features like voice input or AI material tracking. Starts at $49/mo.
Housecall Pro	Booking + payments	Better than most, but still not AI-first. Focus is more on client booking than internal contractor workflow.
Buildertrend / CoConstruct	Project management for builders	Geared toward large construction crews and homebuilders, not electricians or HVAC techs on the road.
QuickBooks + Apps	Invoicing + accounting	Not contractor-friendly UX. Requires manual effort. Doesn't handle job site tasks, notes, materials, or time tracking.

‚ö° What FieldPro Would Do Differently
"Designed for the solo tech or 5-man crew who's too busy to fiddle with software."

Voice-driven input: ‚ÄúLog 3 hours for AC install, add 2 copper pipes.‚Äù

Automatic invoice creation: Sends branded PDF via text or email.

Material tracking: Snap a photo of receipt ‚Üí app logs item & cost.

Offline-first: Works with no signal, syncs later.

Daily summaries: ‚ÄúToday‚Äôs work: 3 jobs, $1,200 earned, 7 hours logged.‚Äù

üí° Bottom Line
Big companies have pieces of this idea, but no one has built:

‚úÖ A simple, AI-powered, mobile-first tool just for small contractors.

It‚Äôs a blue ocean if you focus on:

Smart automation

Offline-friendly UX

Hands-free workflows

üß© Pain Points You'd Be Solving
Problem	FieldPro Solution
Forgetting hours worked on a job	Auto-track time per job site
Losing receipts/materials	AI-scanned expense logging
Manually writing invoices	1-tap branded invoice generation
Client communication chaos	Voice-to-text job notes + status updates
No office help	AI assistant handles admin work

üß† Why AI Makes This Killer
Contractors aren't tech-savvy ‚Üí AI handles complexity for them.

Instead of typing or navigating forms, they talk to the app.

Example: "Hey FieldPro, create an invoice for Mrs. Jacobs ‚Äî 2 hours labor, 1 copper pipe."

üí∞ Big Business Potential
You can charge a monthly fee ($10‚Äì30/user/month).

Add premium features: material inventory tracking, offline sync, QuickBooks export.

Expand to industries like pest control, landscaping, handymen, etc.

üö® No Dominant Player Yet
While there are apps like:

Jobber (expensive, not AI-first)

ServiceTitan (high-end, $200+/mo, hard to use)

Housecall Pro (growing fast, still clunky for small crews)

None offer a true AI-first, mobile-first, simple, affordable solution.

We will want something that will generate money too but not overcharge.
SaaS seems resonable.
Something like...
Free Trial	$0 for 14 days	Full access
Starter	$9.99/month	1 user, basic features
Pro	$29.99/month	Multiple users, invoices, receipts, sync, support
Team	$99/month	Up to 10 users, company dashboard, export tools

We will want an amazing Webpage wanting people to choose us.
We will then want a landing page for the user to log in with.
There will be different levels of access for big players.
This needs to be super customizable.
We need templates and such.
MAKE THIS THE GREATEST APP EVER BUILT!
